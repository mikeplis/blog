Haven't played blitz in a while. My main time to play was in the evening and for a while I was focusing on a coding project during that free time. I still had time to play bullet though and was able to climb a little by implementing stuff from the Building Habits series.

However, I started to plateau a bit. And I realized that on one hand, I was taking chess to seriously, but on the other hand, I wasn't taking it seriously enough.

I found myself getting frustrated at losing, but also not putting in the time to study my games or improve my lines.
