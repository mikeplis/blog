My son was born a few months ago, so I've been struggling with how to use the precious little time I get to myself. For a while, I'd just reach for video games. They were easy and I didn't really have the energy to do anything else.

But after a while, I couldn't shake the feeling that I could be using my free time better. There were all these interesting hobbies to try and things to learn about. Why couldn't I spend my time on those? It was not a new question for me, but it was brought into sharper focus with my newfound dearth of free time.

Another problem is that I have a tendency to get into things and then drop them after a short time. It was hard to get myself to try something new knowing there was a decent chance I'd want to move on after a week or two.

I wrestled with this conundrum for a couple weeks until I had an idea. What if I embraced my natural tendencies instead of fighting against them? How would I approach a new hobby or interest differently if I knew going in that I'd probably drop it after a short time? I realized that if I had some kind of takeaway, it would make the experience feel less like a waste of time, so that's why I wanted to set up this blog. I decided that if I had a space where I could write about my experiences, the burden of sticking with them would be gone.

As an added benefit, I get to practice my writing and I can build my website however I want.

I'm assuming I'll mainly be writing for myself here, but if you've stumbled upon my little slice of the internet...welcome! I hope you find something here worth reading.
