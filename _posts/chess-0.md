title: "Chess #0 - Getting Started*"
---

Normally, this is where I'd write about how I plan to get started with a hobby and lay out my goals, but I've actually been into chess for a few months now. However, it's still the hobby I'm into right now and it's worth writing down how I got started and what my goals are moving forward.

I first got into chess in college, but I only really played for a couple months and then moved on. I started thinking about getting back into it last year and then, like many others, I was inspired to really dive in after *The Queen's Gambit* came out.

I mainly turned to YouTube for learning since there was one channel, [ChessNetwork](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCDOQrpqLqKVcTCKzqarxLg), in particular that I watched a bit in college and quickly discovered a lot of other content creators and chess teachers. I found several playlists I liked and started pouring through those:

* [Chess Fundamentals from John Bartholomew](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl9uuRYQ-6MBwqkmwT42l1fI7Z0bYuwwO)
* [Beginner to Chess Master by ChessNetwork](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLQsLDm9Rq9bHKEBnElquF8GuWkI1EJ8Zp)
* Daniel Naroditsky's [speedrun](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT1F2nOxLHOcmi_qi1BbY6axf5xLFEcit)
* Almost everything from Levy Rozman (aka [GothamChess](https://www.youtube.com/c/GothamChess/playlists))

I had no intention of becoming a serious chess player and just wanted to get through the first few moves without getting destroyed, so I was drawn to openings that I could play pretty much the same way, regardless of what my opponent played: the London System for White and the King's Indian Defense for Black.

I started off playing mainly against bots to get familiar with the basic openings and then I started to play games with very short time controls (1-2 minutes per player - aka bullet) against real players while studying my openings more deeply. That was fine for a time, but I quickly started to realize that I had a hard time navigating the games after the first few moves or if my opponent deviated from the usual lines, so I started to get a little discouraged.

I did try out more aggressive openings for a time to see if those would rekindle my interest in the game, but I was running into a similar problem as before. I knew most of the traps of my openings, but if my opponent didn't play into them, I was lost. Even if they played moves I knew were bad, I wasn't able to consistently punish them for it.

Then, I discovered the [Building Habits series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUjxDD7HNNThftJtE0OIRFRMMFf6AV_69) from Aman Hambleton. In the series, he laid out a set of very basic rules to follow when playing ("Accept all trades", "Castle your king ASAP", etc). His idea was that if players consistenly stuck to the rules, they would learn to play consistently good moves (though maybe not always the best moves) and then over time, they would start to learn when they should or shouldn't deviate from the rules.

I absolutely loved the premise of the series, so I immediately started applying the rules to my games and I noticed an improvement right away. I was definitely missing chances to play winning moves, but I felt like I was able to better navigate all stages of the games because I was getting relatively consistent positions and had some basic rules to fall back on when I wasn't sure what to do.

It was refreshing how practical this series was. I'd learned a lot from general instructional videos and speedruns, but it wasn't always easy to apply that knowledge to my games. Building Habits gave me tools I could start using immediately.

I made two other big changes to how I played. First, I started playing longer games (5 minutes per player - aka blitz). These were still relatively short, but the bullet games just weren't allowing me to think through my moves that much.
